# Flask!

This tutorial will show you how to create a simple hello-world flask app. 

---

## Declaring the Route Decorator


Initially, we add the route decorator

{{< commit add-route-deco >}}

## Add the View Function with the logic

Then, we add the view function with the logic for the URL we just declared using the route decorator.

{{< commit add-view-fn >}}

## Run the Flask App

Finally, we start the Flask app when the python script is run.

{{< commit add-flask-run >}}

Congratulations on your first Flask project!
